1. I'm developing a project called - CRUMBS

2. Here's the elevator pitch - Securely share files and collaborate data online no matter what your storage provider is

3. It's built with - Node.js, react-native, html, css, javascript, sqlite, amazon-ec2, facebook-login-api, c++

4. The team - Runcy Oommen, Souvik Misra

5. Here's the whole story
## Inspiration
